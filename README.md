# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

![Gameplay Screenshot](./images/rock-paper-scissors.jpg)

A simple console-based implementation of the classic game rock-paper-scissors, built using JavaScript.

The game is to train my knowledge of Javascript. Even if there were times that I wasn't sure what to do, or how to use arrays or loops, it was a great exercise to consolidate my exercise and in the end resulted as a great progress and it was a fun little project.

## Instructions

To play the game, simply run the `index.html` file in your browser console.

## Features

- Implemented basic game logic for rock, paper, and scissors.
- Displays the result of each round in the console.
- Allows the player to make choices via console input.

## Issues and Limitations

- Currently, the game doesn't handle ties properly.
- Input validation is minimal and can be improved.
- User experience in the console could be more user-friendly.
