# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

![Gameplay Screenshot](./images/rock-paper-scissors.jpg)

A simple console-based implementation of the classic game rock-paper-scissors, built using JavaScript.

The game serves as a training ground for my JavaScript skills. Despite encountering moments of uncertainty with concepts like arrays and loops, it proved to be an excellent exercise that helped solidify my understanding. Ultimately, it resulted in significant progress and turned out to be a delightful little project.

## Instructions

To play the game, simply run the `index.html` file in your browser console.

## Features

- Implemented basic game logic for rock, paper, and scissors.
- Displays the result of each round in the console.
- Allows the player to make choices via console input.

## Issues and Limitations

- Currently, the game doesn't handle ties properly.
- Input validation is minimal and can be improved.
- User experience in the console could be more user-friendly.
